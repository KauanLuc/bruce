Bruce is a simple command-line password manager and generator.
--
This project is extremely inspired by [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

The Bruce saves your folders and credentials (or whatever you want) in a local directory called **Vault**. The default path to this directory is: `~/.bruce-vault`.
Don't worry, although the path of your passwords is known, the credentials are encrypted under a GPG public key that only your GPG private key can decrypt.

> **Note:** To run Bruce commands, you must have a pre-existing GPG key pair. Additionally, the `tree` command is required.  

If you donâ€™t have a GPG key pair, check out [Generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key) for guidance.  

### **Planned Features**  

The project is still under development. Upcoming updates will include:  

- [X] Commands to add, show, remove, and find credentials  
- [X] A strong password generator for credentials

### **Commands**
Below is the list of available commands and their usage:

### bruce init

Initializes the Bruce Vault directory (`~/.bruce-vault`). If the vault already exists, it notifies the user.

Example:
```
bruce init
```

### bruce add [--print, -p || --open-editor, -op] <credential || folder/credential> <gpg_id>

Adds or updates a credential in the Bruce Vault. The credential is encrypted using the provided GPG key ID (gpg_id).

- Without options: Prompts for a password input (hidden) and encrypts it.
- `--print` or `-p`: Prompts for a password input (visible) and encrypts it.
- `--open-editor` or `-op`: Allows multi-line input (e.g., for notes) until `Ctrl + D` is pressed, then encrypts it.
  
Examples:
```
bruce add github.com mygpgid@gpgkey.com
```
```
bruce add --print github.com mygpgid@gpgkey.com
```
```
bruce add --open-editor github.com mygpgid@gpgkey.com
```

### bruce show <credential>

Decrypts and displays the data of a specific credential stored in the vault.

Example:
```
bruce show github.com
```

### bruce ls

Lists all credentials and folders in the Bruce Vault using the `tree` command. The `ls` command is the default command for Bruce. This means that if you type only `bruce` in the terminal, it will automatically execute the `bruce ls` command.

Example:
```
bruce ls
```

### bruce find <credential>

Searches for a credential in the vault and returns the location of its first occurrence (if found).

Example:
```
bruce find github.com
```

### bruce remove <credential>

Removes a specified credential from the vault if it exists. If multiple instances exist, only the first occurrence is removed.

Example:
```
bruce remove github.com
```

### bruce generate <password_size>

Generates a strong random password with the specified size.

Example:
```
bruce generate 16
```

This command will generate a 16-character random password using a secure method.

### bruce help

Displays a help message listing all available commands and their usage.

Example:
```
bruce help
```
